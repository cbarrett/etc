## Usage

This directory contains the configuration file for [Karabiner-Elements](https://github.com/tekezo/Karabiner-Elements), which remaps keyboard events. It remaps caps lock to control, except when caps lock is tapped, in which case it functions like escape.

- Download the latest release [here](https://github.com/wwwjfy/Karabiner-Elements/releases)
- Symlink ~/.config/karabiner/karabiner.json to karabiner.json in this directory

Note that currently (2017-01-11) this is using a forked version of Karabiner-Elements. Hopefully in the future this won't be necessary.
